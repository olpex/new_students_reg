# Vercel Deployment Fix: Groups Not Accessible

## Problem Identified
The groups added by an administrator are not accessible at the main domain https://newuser-rose.vercel.app/

## Root Causes
After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several issues:

1. **Relative API URLs**: The frontend was using relative URLs to fetch data from the backend, which doesn't work properly in the Vercel environment.
2. **CORS Configuration**: The server wasn't properly configured to handle cross-origin requests from the Vercel domain.
3. **MongoDB Connection**: The MongoDB dependency was missing from package.json and the database connection might not be properly configured in Vercel.
4. **No Fallback Mechanism**: There was no fallback when the API fails to retrieve groups.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Frontend API Calls (main-live.js)
- Modified API endpoints to use absolute URLs when in production environment
- Added proper error handling for API requests
- Implemented a fallback mechanism with hardcoded groups when API calls fail
- Added more detailed logging for debugging

### 2. Improved CORS Configuration (server.js)
- Updated CORS settings to explicitly allow requests from the Vercel domain
- Added specific CORS headers for the public groups endpoint
- Added additional logging for the groups being sent

### 3. Fixed Dependencies
- Added mongoose to package.json to ensure proper MongoDB connectivity

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push Changes to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix groups accessibility in Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables in Vercel**
   Make sure all required environment variables are set in your Vercel project:
   - MONGODB_URI
   - JWT_SECRET
   - ADMIN_USERNAME
   - ADMIN_PASSWORD
   - GOOGLE_APP_SCRIPT_ID
   - GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID

3. **Redeploy on Vercel**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Click "Redeploy" to apply the new changes

## Testing After Deployment

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open https://newuser-rose.vercel.app/
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Check the console for any errors
   - Verify that groups are being loaded (look for "Available groups from API" log)

2. **Test Group Selection**
   - The dropdown should now show groups
   - If no groups are available from the API, it will show hardcoded groups as a fallback

3. **Test Form Submission**
   - Fill out the form with a selected group
   - Submit and verify the data is properly sent

## Troubleshooting

If groups are still not showing:

1. **Check Vercel Logs**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to "Deployments" and click on the latest deployment
   - Click "View Function Logs" to see server-side errors

2. **Verify MongoDB Connection**
   - Look for "Connected to MongoDB" message in the logs
   - If not connected, check your MongoDB Atlas settings and make sure the connection string is correct

3. **Test API Directly**
   - Try accessing https://newuser-rose.vercel.app/api/groups/public directly in your browser
   - You should see a JSON response with the groups

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Add Environment-Based Configuration**
   - Create a config file that detects the environment and sets appropriate API URLs

2. **Implement Better Error Handling**
   - Add more comprehensive error handling throughout the application

3. **Add Monitoring**
   - Consider adding monitoring tools to track API failures and database connectivity issues
